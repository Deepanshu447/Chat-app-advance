                    Most recently, Jack worked on the web platform at Instagram before moving to React.
                    His favorite programming language is JSX.

                    where he now feels privileged to have seen JavaScript development come of age.
                    Though he may not understand how for...of loops work, he loves getting to work with brilliant people on projects that enable amazing UX.
